// Just as equality has a strict counterpart, so too does inequality. Strict inequality will take into account the type of value.

// Setup
function testStrictNotEqual(val) {
  // Only Change Code Below this Line

  if (val !== 17) {

  // Only Change Code Above this Line

    return "Not Equal";
  }
  return "Equal";

// Change this value to test
