// You can concetenate strings by placing + between the two. Spaces will need to be p;aced within the strings if desired - concatenation does not create a space. 

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
